## [PopFactor: Live-Streamer Behavior and Popularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03379/)
_Robert Netzorg, Lauren Arnett, Augustin Chaintreau, Eugene Wu._ [**ICWSM 2021**](https://www.icwsm.org/2021/index.html)\
The Twitch streamer community has curated a set of behavioral norms for how new streamers can quickly grow their audience. We investigate which community-accepted behaviors are predictive of popularity growth over time.

## [Cross-platform Interactions and Popularity in the Live-streaming Community](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3290607.3312900)
_Lauren Arnett, Robert Netzorg, Augustin Chaintreau, Eugene Wu._ [**ACM CHI '19.**](https://chi2019.acm.org/)\
Does having a social media account matter for popularity on Twitch? [Poster](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvqq4s6ex8thtu1/crossplatform_poster.pdf?dl=0).

## [Predicting Eye Fixation Locations on ImageNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurenarnett/eye-movements/master/tex/final_report/lba2138_cm3797.pdf)
_Lauren Arnett, Chengzhi Mao_ (December 2019)\
Predict eye fixation locations on a scene by using a Bayesian learning architecture that combines a learned prior distribution of saliency maps with a deep neural network.

## [TensorFlock](https://github.com/laurenarnett/TensorFlock)
_Joseph Morag, Lauren Arnett, Nick Buonincontri, Elena Ariza_ (May 2018)\
A statically typed, functional tensor representation language with
shape-checking at compile-time.

## [Reverse Engineering the Slide Library](https://learn.columbia.edu/imls/)
Collaboration with Columbia's [Media Center for Art History](https://learn.columbia.edu/) (2017-18) building Optical Character Recognition and halftone detection software toward digitization of Center collection of 35mm slides.
