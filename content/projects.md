Lauren Arnett, Chengzhi Mao (December 2019)\
Use a Bayesian learning architecture to combine a learned prior distribution of saliency maps with a deep neural network for predicting fixation locations.

#### [PopFactor: Live-Streamer Behavior and Popularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03379/)
Robert Netzorg, Lauren Arnett, Augustin Chaintreau, Eugene Wu. arXiv, September 2018\
The Twitch streamer community has curated a set of behavioral norms for how new streamers can quickly grow their audience. We investigate which community-accepted behaviors are predictive of popularity growth over time.
